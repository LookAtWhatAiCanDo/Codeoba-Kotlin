### ⚠️ Platform Signing Models: The Core Difference

Before setting up or modifying configurations, it is critical to understand that macOS and Windows use completely different code-signing architectures.  
Applying the concepts of one platform to the other will cause confusion:

1. **Apple / macOS (File-Based Certificate Model):**
   - **Uses traditional certificate files.** You generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR), submit it to the Apple Developer Portal, download a `.cer` file, and import it into Keychain Access.
   - You then export the certificate and its private key as a password-protected **`.p12` file** (which is PKCS#12—the same format as a Windows `.pfx` file).
   - This `.p12` file is base64-encoded and uploaded directly to GitHub Secrets (`MACOS_CERTIFICATE_P12` / `MACOS_INSTALLER_CERTIFICATE_P12`) so the macOS CI runner can sign the bundle locally.
   - This service is included in the $99/year Apple Developer account.

2. **Microsoft / Windows (Cloud-Based Service Model):**
   - **NO local `.pfx` or certificate files are used.** Microsoft acts as the Certificate Authority and stores the signing keys securely on their cloud HSM (Hardware Security Module) via the **Artifact Signing** service (formerly *Trusted Signing*).
   - You **do not** purchase certificates from third parties (like DigiCert or Sectigo), you **do not** download any `.pfx` files, and you **do not** store any signing password secrets in GitHub.
   - GitHub Actions authenticates keylessly using **OpenID Connect (OIDC)** via an Entra ID App Registration, and sends the built installer to the regional Azure endpoint to be signed in the cloud.
   - This service costs $9.99/month on Azure:

        * Right-click the certificate and choose Export "Developer ID Application...".
        * `developerID_application-WhatAiCanDo.p12`
        * Enter a secure password to encrypt the private key inside the .p12 file.
    * `base64 -i developerID_application-WhatAiCanDo.p12 | pbcopy`
    * Paste that value in the below GitHub secret `MACOS_CERTIFICATE_P12`.

* `Developer ID Application`
    * `Developer ID Installer` (Repeat similar steps if signing `.pkg` installer packages).
    * `base64 -i developerID_installer-WhatAiCanDo.p12 | pbcopy`
    * Paste that value in the below GitHub secret `MACOS_INSTALLER_CERTIFICATE_P12`.

## 🚀 GitHub Actions CI/CD Integration (macOS)

The desktop build pipeline integrates macOS code signing and Apple notarization automatically when building release binaries.

### 1. Required Configuration Parameters

To authenticate and sign, configure these parameters in your GitHub Repository settings:

#### Secrets (Sensitive)
https://github.com/LookAtWhatAiCanDo/Codeoba/settings/secrets/actions:
| Secret Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `MACOS_CERTIFICATE_P12` | Base64-encoded string of the `developerID_application-WhatAiCanDo.p12` file (for `.app` / `.dmg` signing). |
| `MACOS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` | The password used to encrypt the application `.p12` file. |
| `MACOS_INSTALLER_CERTIFICATE_P12` | Base64-encoded string of the `developerID_installer-WhatAiCanDo.p12` file (for `.pkg` signing). |
| `MACOS_INSTALLER_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` | The password used to encrypt the installer `.p12` file. |
| `APPLE_ID_PASSWORD` | App-specific password generated from your Apple ID account page (`appleid.apple.com`). |

> [!NOTE]
> **How to get the `APPLE_ID_PASSWORD`:**
> 1. Navigate to https://account.apple.com/account/manage/section/security.
> 2. Select **App-Specific Passwords**.
> 3. Click **Generate an app-specific password** (or select the `+` button).
> 4. Enter a descriptive label (e.g. `WhatAiCanDo Notarization CI`).
> 5. Click **Create** and complete the verification.
> 6. Copy the generated 16-character password (`xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx`) and paste it as the `APPLE_ID_PASSWORD` secret in GitHub.  
>    Do not use your primary Apple ID login password, as it will fail due to 2FA.

#### Variables (Non-Sensitive)
https://github.com/LookAtWhatAiCanDo/Codeoba/settings/variables/actions:
| Variable Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `APPLE_ID` | `<developer-email>` |
| `APPLE_TEAM_ID` | `<apple-team-id>`: This identifier is public in your app bundle anyway. |

### 2. How it Works in CI
During workflow execution on the `macos-latest` runner:
1. If `MACOS_CERTIFICATE_P12` is defined, the runner decodes it into a temporary keychain.
2. It queries the keychain for the installed certificate identity and exports it to `$MACOS_SIGNING_IDENTITY`.
3. The build process reads this environment variable, applies JIT entitlements ([entitlements.plist](../app-desktop/src/desktopMain/resources/entitlements.plist)), and packages the signed binary.
4. Notarization parameters are uploaded to Apple's notarization servers.
5. The temporary keychain is deleted during the cleanup step.

## Microsoft/Windows Setup (Artifact Signing & OIDC)

Windows `.msi` and `.exe` installers are signed post-build on the GitHub Actions runner using **Artifact Signing** (formerly *Azure Code Signing* / *Trusted Signing*).  
Microsoft acts as the Certificate Authority, removing the need to buy or manage third-party code-signing certificates.

Authentication is managed securely via **OpenID Connect (OIDC)**. This eliminates the need to store long-lived Entra ID credentials (like client secrets, passwords, or certificate files) in GitHub, though identifier parameters (`AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, and `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`) are still configured as GitHub secrets to identify the targets.

### 1. Azure Portal Setup

Follow these steps to set up the signing infrastructure in Azure.

#### Step 1: Sign Up
NOTE: DO NOT USE INDIVIDUAL SIGN UP! Individual sign up generates a weird `${user}${domain}.onmicrosoft.com` domain name that cannot be changed. Only a Windows 365 Business Trial sign up can specify a custom `${domain}.onmicrosoft.com` domain name.

1. Windows 365 Business Trial:  
   https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-365/business/windows-365-free-trial
   * Sign up with your billing email and specify your default Azure domain name.
2. Cancel trial:  
   https://admin.cloud.microsoft/?source=applauncher#/subscriptions
   * Select the business trial subscription.
   * Click **Edit recurring billing** and choose **Cancel on expiration**.
3. Add Custom Domain:  
   https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/DomainsManagementMenuBlade/~/CustomDomainNames
   * Add `whataicando.com` and verify DNS records.
   * Make `whataicando.com` Primary.
4. Setup Users:  
   https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_UsersAndTenants/UserManagementMenuBlade/~/AllUsers
   * Update the primary administrator properties to change the User Principal Name to `<admin-user>@whataicando.com`.
   * Create other admin and developer accounts as needed, assigning appropriate user `Global Administrator` roles and subscription `Owner` roles.

NOTE: Don't be fooled by `$200 free credits` trial offers! If you proceed without upgrading to a `Basic` `pay-as-you-go` account, you will eventually hit this error:
> `"Artifact Signing is not available for free, trial or sponsored subscriptions. Upgrade to a paid subscription to proceed."`

#### Step 2: Sign In
1. Sign in to Azure Portal at https://portal.azure.com/.

#### Step 3: Register the Artifact Signing resource provider

### 2. Microsoft Entra ID (OIDC Connection) Setup

Follow these steps to set up keyless authentication (OIDC) between GitHub Actions and Azure, allowing any repository owned by your organization to sign:

1. Navigate to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com/).
2. In the left menu under **Entra ID**, select **App registrations** -> **New registration**.
3. Configure the registration:
   * **Name:** Enter corporate signing client name.
   * **Supported account types:** Select **`Accounts in this organizational directory only (Single tenant)`**.
4. Click **Register**.
5. Note/Copy the **Application (client) ID** and **Directory (tenant) ID** from the Overview page for later use.

#### Step 2: Configure Federated Credentials (OIDC)
Authorize your GitHub repository to authenticate securely:
1. **Create the GitHub Environment:**
   - In your GitHub Repository, go to **Settings** -> **Environments** -> **New environment**.
   - Name the environment **`Production`** and click **Configure environment**.
2. **Add Federated Credential in Azure:**
   - In the Entra signing client App Registration, select **Certificates & secrets** in the left menu.
   - Select the **Federated credentials** tab at the top and click **Add credential**.
   - Select the scenario: **`GitHub Actions active on a repository`**.
   - Fill in your repository details:
     * **Organization:** Enter `LookAtWhatAiCanDo`.
     * **Repository:** Enter the repository name (e.g., `Codeoba` or `Codeoba-Kotlin`).
     * **Entity type:** Select **`Environment`**.
     * **Environment:** Enter **`Production`**.
     * **Name:** Enter a descriptive identifier (e.g., `GitHub-LookAtWhatAiCanDo-Codeoba-Environment-Production`).
   - Click **Add**.

**Reusing the Setup for Sibling Repositories (e.g., `Codeoba-Kotlin`):**
To sign a different application, you do **not** need to repeat the Azure Portal setup. Simply:
1. Create a **`Production`** environment in the sibling GitHub repository settings.
2. Open the existing Entra signing client App Registration.
3. Go to **Certificates & secrets** -> **Federated credentials** -> **Add credential**.
4. Select **GitHub Actions active on a repository** and fill in the sibling repository name (e.g., `Codeoba-Kotlin`) and choose **Environment** (`Production`).
5. Reuse the same GitHub Actions variables and secrets in the new repository.

#### Step 3: Grant Signing Permission to the App
Grant your Entra App Registration permission to sign using your Artifact Signing account:
1. Open your **Artifact Signing Account** page in the Azure portal.
2. Click **Access control (IAM)** -> **Add** -> **Add role assignment**.
3. Search for the role **`Artifact Signing Certificate Profile Signer`** and click **Next**.
4. Under **Members**, keep *User, group, or service principal* selected and click **+ Select members**.
5. Search for your Entra signing client App Registration, select it, and click **Select**.
6. Click **Review + assign** to save.

## 🚀 GitHub Actions CI/CD Integration (Windows)

The desktop build pipeline uses `azure/login` to authenticate via OIDC, and `azure/artifact-signing-action` to sign the built package post-build.

### 1. Required Configuration Parameters

Configure these parameters in your GitHub Repository settings under **Settings** -> **Secrets and variables** -> **Actions**:

#### Secrets (Sensitive)
These are added as **Repository Secrets** because they contain GUIDs specific to your Azure subscription:

| Secret Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` | The **Application (client) ID** of your Entra App Registration. |
| `AZURE_TENANT_ID` | The **Directory (tenant) ID** of your Entra App Registration. |
| `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` | The **Subscription ID** your Azure subscription. |

#### Variables (Non-Sensitive)
These are added as **Repository Variables**:

| Variable Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `AZURE_SIGNING_ACCOUNT_NAME` | The name of your Azure Artifact Signing Account |
| `AZURE_CERTIFICATE_PROFILE_NAME` | The name of your Certificate Profile |
| `AZURE_TRUSTED_SIGNING_ENDPOINT` | `https://cus.codesigning.azure.net/` (Central US) |

---

### 2. How it Works in CI
During workflow execution on the `windows-latest` runner when a release tag is pushed:
1. The runner requests a temporary OIDC token from GitHub's token authority.
2. The `Azure Login` step uses this OIDC token to authenticate against Azure Entra ID using the client, tenant, and subscription IDs.
3. The runner builds the unsigned package (e.g. `./gradlew packageReleaseMsi` or `npm run tauri build`).
4. The `Sign MSI installer with Azure Artifact Signing` step connects to the Artifact Signing service using the logged-in context, signs the generated package using your Certificate Profile, and appends a secure timestamp.

```yaml
      - name: Azure Login
        if: matrix.platform == 'windows' && startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/v')
        uses: azure/login@v3
        with:
          client-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CLIENT_ID }}
          tenant-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_TENANT_ID }}
          subscription-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID }}

      - name: Sign MSI installer with Azure Artifact Signing
        if: matrix.platform == 'windows' && startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/v')
        uses: azure/artifact-signing-action@v2
        with:
          endpoint: ${{ vars.AZURE_TRUSTED_SIGNING_ENDPOINT || 'https://cus.codesigning.azure.net/' }}
          signing-account-name: ${{ vars.AZURE_SIGNING_ACCOUNT_NAME }}
          certificate-profile-name: ${{ vars.AZURE_CERTIFICATE_PROFILE_NAME }}
          files-folder: 'app-desktop/build/compose/binaries/main-release/msi' # Adjust this path for Tauri (e.g. src-tauri/target/release/bundle/msi)
          files-folder-filter: 'msi'
          file-digest: 'SHA512'
          timestamp-digest: 'SHA512'
          timestamp-rfc3161: 'http://timestamp.acs.microsoft.com'
```

## 📊 Monitoring & Logging

When release builds are signed in CI/CD, execution and verification activity is logged in three separate places:

### 1. GitHub Actions Logs (Runner Execution)
The console output of the `azure/artifact-signing-action` step shows:
- The list of discovered files.
- File hashes (digests) and signing results.
- The regional signing endpoint and certificate profile used.

### 2. Entra ID Sign-In Logs (OIDC Authentication)
Every time GitHub Actions logs in keylessly, it registers as a sign-in event under your service principal App Registration in Microsoft Entra.
* **Where to find it:**
  1. Open the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com/).
  2. In the left menu, select **Identity** -> **Monitoring & health** -> **Sign-in logs**.
  3. Select the **Service principal sign-ins** tab.
  4. Look for your corporate signing client App Registration. If OIDC login fails (e.g., due to configuration mismatches), the exact error description and token claims are listed here.

### 3. Artifact Signing Account Logs (Transaction & Audit)
* **Administrative Audit Logs:** Account-level changes (creating profiles, editing access control) are logged under the **Activity log** tab of your Artifact Signing Account in the Azure portal.
* **Individual File Signing Transaction Logs:** To keep a detailed record of every individual file signed, configure a **Diagnostic setting** targeting an Azure Storage Account. 
  *(Note: Microsoft's Artifact Signing service currently has a known integration issue where transaction logs fail to ingest into Log Analytics workspaces, making them appear empty. Routing to a Storage Account is the reliable, working workaround).*
  1. Go to your **Artifact Signing Account** page in the Azure portal.
  2. Under **Monitoring** in the left menu, select **Diagnostic settings** -> **Edit setting** (on your existing audit setting) or **+ Add diagnostic setting**.
  3. Configure the settings:
     * **Diagnostic setting name:** `whataicando-signing-audit`.
     * **Logs:** Check **`Sign Transactions`** (this logs the actual files signed). Under **Category groups**, check **`audit`** (this logs admin events).
     * **Destination details:** Check **`Archive to a storage account`** (leave *Send to Log Analytics workspace* unchecked).
     * **Subscription / Storage Account:** Select your active subscription and choose or create a simple Azure Storage Account (e.g., `whataicandosigningstore`).
  4. Click **Save** in the top left.
  5. Once saved, every signing transaction will write a JSON log blob inside your storage account under the container `insights-logs-signtransactions`.

### How to View the Log Files:
Azure automatically packages and exports logs to your storage account hourly.
1. In the Azure portal, search for and open your **Storage Account** (`whataicandostorage`).
2. In the left-hand menu under **Data storage**, select **Containers**.
3. Click on the container named **`insights-logs-signtransactions`** (this container is created automatically after your first signed release build runs).
4. Navigate through the folder hierarchy which is organized by date and time:
   `resourceId=.../y=<year>/m=<month>/d=<day>/h=<hour>/m=<minute>/`
5. Click on the file named **`PT1H.json`**.
6. Since these are **Append Blobs** (which Azure Monitor uses to write logs sequentially), the Azure Portal's built-in **Edit** or **Preview** tab will display a warning (*"Only block blobs can be edited from the Portal"*) and will not render the contents.
7. To view the log data, you must use one of the following methods:
   - **Download the file:** Click the **Download** button and open the `.json` file in your local text editor.
   - **Use Azure Storage Explorer:** Use the desktop application (available from the [Azure Storage Explorer Download Page](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/storage/storage-explorer#Download-4)) to preview the file directly.
   - **Use Azure CLI:** Run the following command to download and display the contents directly in your terminal screen without saving a local file:
     ```bash
     az storage blob download \
       --account-name whataicandostorage \
       --container-name insights-logs-signtransactions \
       --name "<full-blob-path-copied-from-portal-properties>" \
       --file /dev/stdout \
       --auth-mode login
     ```
